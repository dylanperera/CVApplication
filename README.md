# CV Builder Application

Motivation
I realised that there are a ton of questions every now and then, with regards to building a presentable CV for job applications. Although I believe that the structure of CVs should be dependent on the nature of the applicants' career choices, the CV should still be simple, clear and readable.

I have created an implementation of a CV creator based on a template that I use for my own CV. This template has clear headings, and simple yet readable sections, where styles only differ to separate organisations / date, positions / locations, and descriptions.

Features
The app features a Form, and a sticky template element. This template element will fill up whenever information is entered into the form. The form features a few Sub Sections:

General Information
Education experience
Work experience
Other expertise the user might want to share in his CV
Technologies used
This application is created with React, and the main learning point of the project is the use of State Hooks.

The project is styled with styled-components.

One of the features of the project is to allow the user to download the CV-template in PDF format. The following packages are used to make that possible:

html2canvas documentation
jsPDF documentation
Nice to have future implementations
I would implement these few changes to improve the application:

Further Form Validation
Expand on the Expertise component - allow users to define headings for expertise subjects, while maintaining the current input box for subject examples
Add a portfolio input to be shown in the expertise component, while LinkedIn / website input is maintained in General Info
Adding API calls to city input and school input, for user to select their cities / schools
Selection of Month + Year for date inputs.
